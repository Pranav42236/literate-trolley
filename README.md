# literate-trolley
This project builds a web-connected, RFID-powered smart shopping trolley with live cart, checkout, and extras like supermarket map and entertainment. It uses ESP32, RFID, WiFi, web server, and WebSocket for real-time browser-based control. You can freely modify, use, and publish this code on GitHub for learning or further development.
