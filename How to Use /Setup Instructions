Step 1: Assemble Hardware
Connect the MFRC522 RFID module to the ESP32 with the following pin configuration:

SDA (SS) → GPIO 15

RST → GPIO 5

SCK → GPIO 18

MOSI → GPIO 23

MISO → GPIO 19

3.3V → 3.3V on ESP32

GND → GND on ESP32

Step 2: Prepare Your Environment
Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.

Add ESP32 board support:

In Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences.

Add to "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Open Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search "ESP32" and install the package.

Install required libraries via Library Manager:

Step 3: Configure the Code
Open the smart_trolley.ino file in Arduino IDE.

Edit the WiFi credentials (ssid and password) to match your network.

Update the validUIDs array to match your RFID tag UIDs if needed.

Step 4: Upload Code to ESP32
Select your ESP32 board model under Tools > Board.

Select the correct COM port under Tools > Port.

Click Upload to flash the code to your ESP32.

Open the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud to monitor connection status and get the ESP32 IP address.

Step 5: Use the System
Open a web browser on a device connected to the same WiFi network.

Navigate to the ESP32's IP address shown in the Serial Monitor.

Use the web interface to view your cart, payment summary, supermarket map, entertainment, and settings.

Scan RFID tags near the MFRC522 reader to add or remove products, with live cart updates on the web interface
